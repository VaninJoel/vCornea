ðŸ“‚ Data Availability and Reproducing Results

The raw simulation data used in the manuscript is not stored in this GitHub repository because it exceeds GitHubâ€™s file size limits.
Instead, all datasets have been archived on Zenodo and are freely available at:

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16764319

ðŸ“¦ Contents of the Zenodo Archive

  Each experiment is stored in its own folder (e.g., (Mild) 1500_G/Comb0/...), with multiple replicates run using the same initial parameters.
  
  Within each replicate folder, you will find:
  
  Simulation/ â€” numerical outputs such as:
  
  cell_count_*.csv â€“ cell count time series
  
  surfactant_*.csv â€“ surfactant concentration over time
  
  thickness_rep_*.parquet â€“ tissue thickness data
  
  LatticeData/ â€” CompuCell3D .vtk snapshots for visual inspection or rendering.

## ðŸ“Š Reproducing the Figures from the Paper

This repository allows you to either:

1. **Plot the results from the published raw data** (simplest option)  
2. **Run the simulation yourself** and plot your own outputs  

We recommend using a **separate conda environment** so that dependencies for plotting and simulation donâ€™t interfere with other Python projects you may have.

### Option 1 â€” ðŸ“ˆ Plot from Published Data (No Simulation Required)

If you only want to generate the manuscript figures from the published data, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Miniconda or Anaconda (if you donâ€™t have it already)
[Miniconda download](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (lightweight option)

#### 2. Create and activate a plotting environment
```bash
conda create -n vcornea_plot python=3.10
conda activate vcornea_plot
```
